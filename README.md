# opensurgbot_board

Board design for the opensurgbot first prototype.

## About

The opensurgbot was temporarily named _deehli_, and the board design has not been updated since the name change. Thus, the kicad files and the board name still refer to _deehli_.

## Known issues
For ZDT ports, 15V and Gnd ports are swapped !
- The 15-5V DC-DC regulator is rather hard to find, used another one
- Several trace connections were forgotten in version vB-1.02
